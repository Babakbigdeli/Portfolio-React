          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold">About Me</h2>
          <p className="mt-2 text-gray-600">Living in Greater Manchester, I graduated from the University of Manchester's Bootcamp.
      Having developed a passion for coding which evolved after finding and tweaking VBA codes to use in MS Access and Excel. I spent many years working in the Admin and 
      logistics industry until I decided to learn a new skill and change my line of work because I felt the need to expand my horizons. 
      The bootcamp was a 24-week intensive programme focused on teaching programming skills in 
      JavaScript, jQuery, HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap, NodeJS, MySQL, MongoDB, ReactJs, Express, Handelbars and Firebase.  This enabled me to acquire a sound understanding of programming, 
      with a focus on test-driven development and collaborative version control with Github. I gained experience with backend technologies, building APIs and servers with Express and 
      MySql, whilst also covering the front-end with React and CSS. This is just the start of my journey and I am excited to be in a world that demands continuous learning and development. 
      I look forward to keeping up with the evolving knowledge for the rest of my career..</p>
