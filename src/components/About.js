          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold">About Me</h2>
          <p className="mt-4">Over 15 years in logistics and administration at major firms such as Total 
Energies, Aramex, DHL, K&N, and JD Sports introduced me to advanced use of 
Microsoft Office, especially for process optimization. That exposure sparked a 
growing interest in coding with VBA and SQL, enabling me to design custom 
spreadsheets, automate workflows, and manage databases more efficiently. During 
the COVID-19 pandemic, I recognized a unique chance to pivot into tech, 
enrolling in a rigorous 24-week MERN bootcamp at Manchester University to 
expand my programming capabilities. 
A few month later, I started worked as a Shopify Developer with Open Supplies, 
where I focused on enhancing user experiences and improving the overall 
functionality of multiple e-commerce platforms. Eager to tackle more complex 
challenges, I then joined Intellithing, collaborating on the creation of an AI- 
focused web portal using Scrum principles and GitHub for version control. 
Between sprints, I supported digital marketing initiatives, leveraging LinkedIn 
Sales Navigator and Pipedrive to help drive growth and engagement. 
 
I continuously sharpen my development skills through coding challenges, stay 
informed via tech news, and explore Generative AI to uncover innovative 
solutionsâ€”learning from it (or perhaps learning with it!).Drawing on my 
extensive administrative background and problem-solving drive, I bring a 
distinctive perspective to any project. I look forward to applying my 
adaptability, creativity, and strong work ethic in a new role, where I can 
contribute not only to technical development but also to the broader goals and 
success of the organization. </p>
